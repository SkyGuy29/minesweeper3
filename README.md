# SFML-Template

This is a SFML template for a visual studio console app in c++.
This uses the 64 bit version of SFML 2.6.2, to change the version theoretically you can switch the SFML folder out with a new one with the same name.
This includes graphics, audio, and networking.

I have absolutly no idea if any of this works but sfml did compile and run correctly so I did something right.
